    {(Draft) Broadcast Time Protocol Standard}

The Broadcast Time Protocol specifies the behavior of both producers and consumers of 
broadcast time information.  Only the producer behavior is checked here.

These checks are done for each defined clock separately. 
For example, they can be run on the 01.01.00.00.01.00 Default Fast Clock
followed by running them for the 01.01.00.00.01.01 Default Real-time Clock.

\section{Broadcast Time Protocol Producer Procedure}

\checkProcedure{Broadcast Time Protocol Checking}

\subsection{Clock Query checking}

This checks that the Clock Query defined in Section 6.4 of the Standard results in the
Clock Synchronization sequence defined in section 6.3.

The clock query is sent. 
Then the specific reports in items 1 through 6 are checked for, in order.

Note that the values of the time, date, rate, state are not checked in this step.

\subsection{Clock Set checking}

This checks that the Clock Set operations defined in Section 6.5 of the Standard results 
in new clock settings followed by the
Clock Synchronization sequence defined in section 6.3.

This sets the clock to 01:23 AM on July 22, 2023 with the rate set to 4X and the clock stopped.

The check then waits up to 4 seconds for a Clock Synchronization sequence, which it checks for
the specific time, date, rate and state that was previously set.

\subsection{Requested time checking}

This checks that the Report Time Event indicated in bullet 2 of section 6.2 is 
produced when requested.

First this check sends a Consumer Identified message for the 01:24AM  July 22, 2023 event.

Then it sets the clock to 01:23 AM on July 22, 2023 with the rate set to 5X and the clock running.

It then waits up to 15 seconds for the production of the 01;24AM Report Time Event.

\subsection{Startup Sequence checking}

This checks the startup sequence described in section 6.1 of the Standard.

The node being checked is manually restarted.

The resulting message traffic is then checked for the required elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Producer Range Identified and Consumer Range Identified messages, in either order.
\item A Clock Synchronization sequence as defined in section 6.3.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the existence of the Clock Synchronization messages are checked, but not 
their contents.  The Clock is allowed to start up with any time value.
