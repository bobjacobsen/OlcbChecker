\section{Frame Level Procedure}

\checkProcedure{Frame Layer Checking}

\subsection{Initialization}

This section's checks cover Frame Transfer Standard sections 4, 6.1 and section 6.2.1.

The checks assume that the node reserves a single alias at startup.

Follow the prompts when asked to reset or otherwise initialize the DBC.

The checker waits up to 30 seconds for the node to restart and 
go through a node reservation sequence.

\begin{enumerate}
\item All frames carry the same source alias
\item The sequence of four RID frames, a CID frame, and AMD frame are sent
\item The Node ID in the RID frames matches the Node ID in the AMD frame
\item That the Node ID matches that of the node being checked
\item Neither the alias\footnote{See section 6.3 of the Standard} 
nor the Node ID\footnote{See section 5.12 of the Unique Identifiers Standard.}
is zero.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{AME Sequences}

This section's checks cover Frame Transfer Standard sections 4, 6.1 and section 6.2.3.

The checks assume that the node has previously reserved at least one alias
and is in the Permitted state.

The checker sends an AME frame with no NodeID and checks for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An AMD frame in response
\item That carries the Node ID of the DBC
\end{enumerate}

The checker sends an AME frame with the Node ID of the DBC and checks the response for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An AMD frame in response
\item That carries the Node ID of the DBC
\end{enumerate}

The checker sends an AME frame with a Node ID different from the Node ID of the DBC 
and checks for no response.


\subsection{Alias Conflict}

This section's checks cover Frame Transfer Standard sections 4, 6.1 and section 6.2.5.

The checks assume that the node has previously reserved at least one alias
and is in the Permitted state.

The checker sends an AME frame to acquire the DBC's current alias from the AMD
response.

The checker sends an CID frame with the DBC's alias and checks for
\begin{enumerate}
\item An RID frame in response
\item That carries the alias of the DBC.
\end{enumerate}

The checker sends an AMD frame with the DBC's alias and checks for
\begin{enumerate}
\item An AMR frame in response
\item That carries the source alias of the DBC.
\end{enumerate}

At this point, Frame Transfer Standard section 6.2.5 specifies that the node must stop
using that alias.  Many nodes will reserve a different one at this point.

If an alias reservation sequence does start, 
the first frame will be checked for a proper CID frame.  
In addition, the checker will check that the 
newly reserved alias is different from the original one.

Having reserved an alias, many nodes will put it into use with an AMD frame. 
If one is received, it will be checked to see if it contains the new alias
and the DBC's node ID.

Once traffic on the bus has paused, indicating the completion of 
any allocation(s), the checker will emit an AME frame.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If an AMD has been received, there should be exactly one
        reply with the DBC's node ID.  It should carry the new alias.
\item If an AMD has not been received, there should be no 
        replies with the DBC's node ID or with the new alias.
\end{enumerate}

Note: The Standards allow other initialization sequences, and this check
is not completely general.  If a DBC doesn't pass, the sequence should
be carefully examined in light of the CAN Frame Transfer Standard
to determine if it's just an issue with the check logic.
\subsection{Reserved Frame Bit}

This section's checks cover Frame Transfer Standard sections 4, 6.1 and section 6.2.3., 
specifically that the 0x1000\_0000 bit in the CAN header is properly
ignored.

The checker sends an AME frame with zero in the 0x1000\_0000 bit
and with no NodeID and checks for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An AMD frame in response,
\item That carries the Node ID of the DBC,
\item With the 0x1000\_0000 bit set to one.
\end{enumerate}
