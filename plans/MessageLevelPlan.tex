\section{Message Network Procedure}

\checkProcedure{Message Network checking}

\subsection{Node Initialized checking}

This section checks the interaction in Standard section 3.4.1 Node Initialization.

It does this by having the operator reset/restart the DBC and then
checking that a Node Initialized message is received and
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The Node Initialized message is the first message received.
            \footnote{See Section 3.2 of the Standard}
    \item The message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \item The message uses the appropriate MTI
            \footnote{See Section 3.3.1 of the Standard}
            for whether PIP indicates the node 
            uses the Simple Protocol or not.
    \item The data part of the message contains the source node ID.
    \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Verify Node checking}

This section checks the interaction in Standard section 3.4.2 Node ID Detection.

It does this by

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sending a global Verify Node ID message and checking the reply.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The reply message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \item The reply message contains the Node ID of the DBC in its data field.
    \item The reply message uses the appropriate MTI
            \footnote{See Section 3.3.3 fo the Standard}
            for whether PIP indicates the node 
            uses the Simple Protocol or not.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Sending a Verify Node ID message addressed to the DBC and checking the reply.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The reply message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \item The reply message contains the Node ID of the DBC in its data field.
    \item The reply messages uses the appropriate MTI for whether PIP indicates the node 
            uses the Simple Protocol or not.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Sending a Verify Node ID message addressed to a different address from the DBC
        and checking for the absence of a reply.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protocol Support Inquiry checking}

This section checks the interaction in Standard section 3.4.3 Protocol Support Inquiry and Response.

It does this by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sending a Protocol Support Inquiry message to the node, 
and checking for the resulting Protocol Support Response message.  
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The reply message is addressed to the checking node.
    \item The reply message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \end{enumerate}
The check displays the resulting list of supported protocols for checking against the 
DBC's documentation.

\item Sending a Protocol Support Inquiry message addressed to a different address from the DBC
        and checking for the absence of a reply.
        
\item Sending three Protocol Support Inquiry messages from three separate node IDs
        as fast as possible, i.e. at line rate allowing for interleaved replies, 
        followed by checking for three replies.  These can be either Protocol Support 
        Response message(s), 
        Terminate Due to Error message(s)
        or Optional Interaction Rejected\footnote{
            Protocol Support Inquiry is not an \underline{optional} message per se, 
            so this check may be excessively accepting. See section 3.5.3 and
            section 3.5.1 of the Message Network Standard for background.
        }
        message(s).  In either
        case, the mandatory fields in the messages are checked for correctness.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Optional Interaction Rejected checking}

This section checks the interaction in Standard section 3.5.1 Reject Addressed Optional Interaction.

First it sends a global unallocated MTI
\footnote{Initially 0x030. Others may be added in the future for an eventual
    check of all possible unallocated MTIs}
and checks for no reply.

It then sends an unallocated MTI
\footnote{Initially 0x048. Others may be added in the future for an eventual
    check of all possible unallocated MTIs}
addressed to a checker node (i.e. not the DBC)
and checks for no reply.

Finally, it sends an unallocated MTI
addressed to the DBC and checking for the Optional Interaction Rejected 
message in reply.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The reply message is addressed to the checking node.
    \item The reply message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \item The reply message carries at least four bytes of content, with the 
            third and fourth bytes carrying the original MTI.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Duplicate Node ID Discovery checking}

This section checks the interaction in Standard section 3.5.4 Duplicate Node ID Discovery.

It does this by sending a global Verified Node ID message with the 
identified node ID set to the DBC's ID. This message should have
only been emitted by the DBC.

The checker then looks for the well-known global event.  If it finds that, the check passes.
If not, it prompts the operator to confirm that indication has been made 
``using whatever indication technology is available'', e.g. via LEDs or other form.

\section{Frame Level Procedure}

This section is only applicable to implementations what use a CAN-format link layer
implementation, e.g. via a USB-CAN adapter or by using Grid Connect coding
over a TCP/IP link. See Standard section 7.

All checks in the prior section are assumed to have passed before these
checks are run, as they depend on message-layer behaviors.

In general, proper operation of the frame level is checked by 
exercising it through the message level in the checks above and in subsequent 
documents.  We limit ourselves here to checking atypical behaviors.

\subsection{Reserved Field Handling}

This section discusses the reserved bit fields described in Standard section 3.1.1.

The CAN implementation does not carry bits 15-14 nor bit 12 of the MTI. 
The full 12 bits of the rest of the MTI are checked in other sections of this check plan.

However, in a CAN implementation, the 0x1\_0000\_0000 bit is reserved, send as 1, 
don't check on receipt.

To check this, the checker sends a Verify Node ID Global with zero in the 0x1\_0000\_0000
bit. It then checks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item That a Verified Node ID message frame is received from the DBC,
\item That the 1\_0000\_0000 bit in that frame is a one.
\end{enumerate}
