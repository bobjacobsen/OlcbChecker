\section{Simple Node Information Protocol Procedure}

\checkProcedure{SNIP Checking}

A node which does not self-identify in PIP that it supports
the Simple Node Information Protocol should be considered to have passed these checks.
\pipsetFootnote

\subsection{SNIP reply checking}

This section checks the format of the reply message in Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Standard.

It does this by issuing a Simple Node Information Request message, 
accumulating the reply(s), and then checking:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The message indicates its source is the DBC.
    \item The message indicates its destination is the checking node.
    \item The version byte at the start of the first section is either 1 or 4.
    \item The version byte at the start of the second section is either 1 or 2.
    \item There are exactly six zero bytes.
    \item Each of the six defined strings is no longer than its defined maximum length.
    \item There are no data byte(s) after the sixth zero byte.
    \end{enumerate}
