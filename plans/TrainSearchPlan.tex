    {Train Search Protocol Standard}

The Train Search Protocol specifies the behavior of both providers and requestors of 
train search information.  Only the provider is checked here.


\section{Train Search Protocol Provider Procedure}

\checkProcedure{Train Search Protocol Provider Checking}

These checks require the attached node, when appropriately commanded,
to create a virtual train node with address 12.

\subsection{Virtual Train Node creation check}

This checks the interaction in section 6.2 of the Standard
followed by checking the interaction in section 6.1 of the Standard.

This check must start with the device being checked having not created a
virtual node with address 12. For some devices, doing a power cycle will 
drop all virtual nodes and prepare the device for this check.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
    not-Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0x60.
    
\item Wait one second for a reply.  There should not be one.

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
    Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0xE0.

\item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
    should be received.

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 00x12.FF.FF and 
    not Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0x60.

\item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
    should be received.    

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Match partial values check}

This is checking aspects of the Event Identifier matching algorithm described
in section 6.3 of the Standard.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Ensure node with address 12 exists; may have been created in the previous check.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
        Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0xE0.

    \item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
        should be received.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Search not-allocate for partial match on 2; should exist
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x2F.FF.FF and 
        not-Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0x60.

    \item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
        should be received.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Search not-allocate for partial match on 1; should exist
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x1F.FF.FF and 
        not-Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0x60.

    \item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
        should be received.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

(An additional check that 0x23 doesn't match would be good, but is there a good-enough way
to ensure that a locomotive matching that number doesn't exist during the check?)

\subsection{Reserved address values check}

This is checking the reserved values found in Table 2 of section 5.2 of the Standard.

Having 0xA through 0xE in a search nibble should result in no matches.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Ensure node with address 12 exists; may have been created in the previous check.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
        Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0xE0.

    \item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
        should be received.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x0B.FF.FF and 
    Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0xE0.

\item Wait one second for a reply.  There should not be one.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reserved address values check}

This is checking the reserved values found in Table 4 of section 5.2 of the Standard.

Having reserved values in the protocol nibble should result in no matches.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Ensure node with address 12 exists; may have been created in the previous check.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
        Allocate, Exact, Address Only, Any/Default protocol 0xE0.

    \item Wait up to one second for a reply.  A Producer Identified Valid for the same event ID
        should be received.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
    protocol byte Allocate plus reserved values 0xF0.

\item Wait one second for a reply.  There should not be one.

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
    protocol byte Allocate plus reserved values 0xF8.

\item Wait one second for a reply.  There should not be one.

\item Send a search Identify Producer with search nibbles 0x12.FF.FF and 
    protocol byte Allocate plus reserved values 0xE3.

\item Wait one second for a reply.  There should not be one.

\end{enumerate}
