\section{Introduction}

Some information about construction of the node being checked can't readily be obtained
from active checks on the LCC bus. Some information is needed to make those active 
checks effective.  This questionnaire is meant to deal with both of those
by getting specific implementation details from the device implementer.

This questionnaire should be filled out with details from the specific device being checked.
If the device does not implement a protocol, mark that section as ``Not Applicable''.

This is divided into sections corresponding to the specific check plans.

Please feel free to add extra pages as needed.

\section{Unique IDs}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the Unique ID(s) of the device being checked?
        \item Was the Unique ID(s) assigned from a range under the control of the implementor? 
        \item Does the implementor assign different Unique IDs to individual nodes?
    \end{enumerate}
