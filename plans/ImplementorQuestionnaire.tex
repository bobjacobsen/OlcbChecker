\section{Introduction}

Some information about construction of the node being checked can't readily be obtained
from active checks on the LCC bus. Some information is needed to make those active 
checks effective.  This questionnaire is meant to deal with both of those
by getting specific implementation details from the device implementer.
It should be filled out with details from the specific device being checked.
It's divided into sections corresponding to the specific check plans.

Please feel free to add extra pages as needed.

\section{Unique IDs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the Unique ID(s) of the node being checked?
    \item Was the Unique ID(s) assigned from a range under the control of the implementor? Which?
    \item Does the implementor assign different Unique IDs to individual nodes?
\end{enumerate}

\section{CAN Physical Layer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device use standard CAN transceiver(s) from recognized vendors?
    \item Does the device use standard CAN controller(s) from recognized vendors?
    \item If the device has more than two LCC jacks, how are they to be used?
    \item Is the device properly labeled with power sourcing and/or sinking current labels?
        Are the current values listed on the label(s) correct?
    \item Does the device obey the timing constraints listed in the Standard?
    \item Does the device use or provide a DCC signal on the optional conductors?
\end{enumerate}

\section{CAN Frame Transfer Layer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the node transmit extended-format remote frames (frames with RTR set)?
    \item How does the device signal the detection of a duplicate node ID?
            (See section 6.2.6 of the Standard)
    \item Does the device report changes in the CAN link status? 
            (See section 6.2.7 of the Standard)
    \item Does the device use the recommended algorithm for generating alias values?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If not, please describe how the node meets the requirements of the 
                CAN Frame Level Standard section 6.3.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Message Transport Layer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Standard section 3.5.4 requires that "OpenLCB nodes shall indicate an 
        error when they detect an incoming message with a Source Node ID
        equal to their own". How does this device do that?
    \item Does the device meet the timing requirements in section 3.7 Delays and Timeouts?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simple Node Information Protocol}
\subsection{Simple Node Information Protocol Producers}

\subsection{Simple Node Information Protocol Consumers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device properly decode future versions of the SNIP
        information? (See Section 5.2 of the Standard.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Event Transport Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If there are default values configured for Event IDs in the device,
        from what range are those allocated? Is that a range that has been
        allocated to the manufacturer?
    \item  If there are default values configured for Event IDs in the device,
        are those different for every device produced? How is uniqueness
        guaranteed?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Datagram Transport Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Memory Configuration Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Configuration Definition Information (CDI)}
\subsection{CDI Producers}

\subsection{CDI Consumers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device decode and display all the element types in section 
            5.1 of the Standard?
    \item Does the device properly handle additional, unknown elements? 
            (See Section 6 of the Standard)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Train Control Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Standard section 7.1 says that
        ``A Train Node representing a DCC locomotive ... may, 
        but is not required to provide the last written data upon a read command.''.
        Does this device provide the data in that case?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Train Search Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does this device participate in the Train Search Protocol, 
            either by making search requests or by replying to them?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Function Definition Information (FDI)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
