\section{Introduction}

Some information about construction of the node being checked can't readily be obtained
from active checks on the LCC bus. Some information is needed to make those active 
checks effective.  This questionnaire is meant to deal with both of those
by getting specific implementation details from the device implementer.
It should be filled out with details from the specific device being checked.
It's divided into sections corresponding to the specific check plans.

Please feel free to add extra pages as needed.

\section{Unique IDs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the Unique ID(s) of the node being checked?
    \item Was the Unique ID(s) assigned from a range under the control of the implementor? Which?
    \item Does the implementor assign different Unique IDs to individual nodes?
\end{enumerate}

\section{CAN Physical Layer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device use standard CAN transceiver(s) from recognized vendors?
    \item Does the device use standard CAN controller(s) from recognized vendors?
    \item If the device has more than two LCC jacks, how are they to be used?
\end{enumerate}

\section{CAN Frame Transfer Layer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device use the recommended algorithm for generating alias values?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If not, please describe how the node meets the requirements of the 
            CAN Frame Level Standard 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Message Transport Layer}

\section{Simple Node Information Protocol}
\subsection{Simple Node Information Protocol Producers}

\subsection{Simple Node Information Protocol Consumers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device properly decode future versions of the SNIP
        information? (See Section 5.2 of the Standard.)
\end{enumerate}


\section{CDI}
\subsection{CDI Producers}

\subsection{CDI Consumers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does the device decode and display all the element types in section 
            5.1 of the Standard?
    \item Does the device properly handle additional, unknown elements? 
            (See Section 6 of the Standard)
\end{enumerate}
